## 👋 Hello, my username is PCPPTech/Eidnoxon! 👋
## 👨‍💻 I really enjoy coding and building my own applications! 👨‍💻
- For projects I use python because I think I am advanced level at it
- I like the concept of using `C++` and i am currently learning `golang` and trying to get myself to learn `web development`!
## ☕ My favorite thing is coding at night with a cup of coffee ^^ ☕ 
## 😴 My dream is to work at Microsoft oneday! 😴

I know AI is gonna take over the programming industry and replace me, but it is fun to code.
